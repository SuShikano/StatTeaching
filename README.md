# StatTeaching
This is a repo for the materials which I prepared for the statistics lecture.

The "rmd" folder contains the rmarkdown files (.rmd) and their products in the html format (.html) and the pdf format (.pdf). The html files can be opend by using conventional browser (e.g. firefox, chrome, safari).

The "func" folder contains r-functions, which are used in multiple rmarkdown files.
