# StatTeaching
This is a repo for the materials which I prepared for the statistics lecture.

The "rmd" folder contains the rmarkdown files (.rmd) and their products in the html format (.html) and the pdf format (.pdf). The html files can be opend by using conventional browser (e.g. firefox, chrome, safari).

The html format files can be seen by one of the following ways:
1) You download the files to your local machine and open them by using a browser.
2) Go to https://htmlpreview.github.io/ and paste the url address of the html.file

The "func" folder contains r-functions, which are used in multiple rmarkdown files.
